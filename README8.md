# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 8
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 5 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the eighth week of this subject, I will be conducting a learning experiment about the efficiency of two different types of information sources in comparison to each other.

# Content Insights
**Hypothesis:** 
Students who acquire their knowledge from written website content, will be able to recall a larger quantity of information over video content on the same topic.

**Test:**
The learning topic for this experiment will be the following: _Making sure that computer software is up-to-date, and why it is important._

The process of this test will be as follows:
1. Find one website and one video on the same study topic.
2. Read the website content
3. Withdraw from the study area for 30mins, for the purposes of testing one's grasp of information.
4. Once the time has elapsed, 3 questions regarding what has been learned will be answered to determine the amount of recalled knowledge.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 using the video content
6. Compare the amount of knowledge recalled from the two sources.

For the purposes of this test, the following website and video will be studied:

Website: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/5-reasons-software-updates-are-important

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsIjURz8Qig

The efficiency of each learning medium will be determined by a set number of questions relating to their shared content  (used for both mediums), with the answers for each question being compared to one another for quality of information derived.

**Results:**

Website:
_Q1: What is one benefit of keeping software up-to-date?_
- One of the benefits is that it allows for security vulnerabilities to be patched.

_Q2: What is a threat actor known to search for on a compromised system?_
- Personal details including names, phone numbers, financial and medical information.

_Q3: What is one reason as to why a software manufacturer would send an update to a device?_
- One reason may be for the installation of new features.
