# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 8 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The process of learning about 'mixins' within SASS has been a wonderful method to learn about. The reason being that its capabilities allow for highly adaptable usages of classes and variables, that I've found to significantly increase the number of options at my disposal for the delivery of CSS elements within a site. I am feeling more confident about my web development abilities as a result.
