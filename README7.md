My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the seventh week of this subject, I have learnt about PHP programming and the ways in which it can be used to augment the content of a site (LinkedIn learnings from the link below). I have also made progress with my team and our group assignment.

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 9 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The process of learning PHP I have found to be quite familiar and intriguing, as PHP programming make use of elements present in other programming and non-programming languages, such as the dynamic typing from Python and the different text types from HTML, respectively.


This week, myself and my team began work on our group website, where we decided that our first main objective was to get the client content onto the site, with our custom theme being planned for the following week.
