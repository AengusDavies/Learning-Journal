# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 7
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the seventh week of this subject, I have learnt about PHP programming and the ways in which it can be used to augment the content of a site (LinkedIn learnings from the link below). I have also made progress with my team and our group assignment.

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 9 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The process of learning PHP I have found to be quite familiar and intriguing, as PHP programming make use of elements present in other programming and non-programming languages, such as the dynamic typing from Python and the different text types from HTML, respectively.


This week, myself and my team were introduced to the group project and the client website known as U3Aonline, where we collectively took notes on various important details that we will later use for our development process, namely the focus on online courses presented as PDF files, the design requirements for the logo and colour scheme, as well as the target audience that our website is to be directed towards (all mentioned in the "Goals!" page on our team Trello board).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After the completion of this practical, 

I did some research on some of the ways in which my group's efficiency could be improved going into the project (research deriving from the website shown below). The main method that caught my attention was the one regarding prowess of documentation, which discusses the importance of extracting the right information from stakeholders, as well as the importance of presenting the information in a way that is legible and usable.

The notes that I collected from the project client, whilst useful, would benefit from further additions that aim to rectify any misunderstandings, with extra care taken to how the information is documented for use within the project.
