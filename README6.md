# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 6
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the sixth week of this subject I have been introduced to the group assignment, the team that I will be working with, as well as the client website for the project. I have also learnt about project management and the ways in which the Agile process is employed within a development team (from the link below)

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 4 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The process of learning project management this week has been quite familiar, as two subjects that I had completed in the past also went into detail regarding Agile and Scrum processes, namely _CP3405 - Design Thinking and Project Management_ in addition to _CP3407 - Advanced Software Engineering._

This week, myself and my team were introduced to the group project and the client website known as U3Aonline, where we collectively took notes on various important details that we will later use for our development process, namely the focus on online courses presented as PDF files, the design requirements for the logo and colour scheme, as well as the target audience that our website is to be directed towards (all mentioned in the "Goals!" page on our team Trello board).
