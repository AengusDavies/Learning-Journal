# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 1
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the first week of this subject I watched the LinkedIn learning activity content for week 1, focusing on the sections that were relevant for the practical task. My main goal was to bring myself back up to speed with HTML and CSS that is necessary for these practical tasks as well as the upcoming assessments.

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 7 hours of my own time this week on the subject
# Content Insights
The useful introduction to HTML and CSS (re-introduction for me) that I received from the practicals played a key part in bringing myself back up to speed from the web design subject that I completed a couple years ago (CP1406 - Web Design and Development). It was also my first step into website hosting, where I employed the use of Netlify after wrestling with many other options. I am feeling more confident about my ability to host more websites going forward in the subject.
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Upon completion of this practical, I have learned that the hosting option mentioned in Content Insights offers a quick means for small website deployment (assuming one remembers to name the HTML file as index.html !!!)
Going forward past this practical, I will finish learning the remainder of the LinkedIn content, which discusses the no-code movement among other interesting content.
