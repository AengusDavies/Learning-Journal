# Content Insights
The process of learning how to create a child theme from my WordPress assignment was an intuitive experience, which included the installation and usage of the child theme configurator plugin for the purposes of this practical. As I made modifications to the CSS on my site after inspecting the website code for the desired changes, I went through the process of going through the inspect code in order to find components that were suitable for modification, which is where I then modified the navigation menu elements, as the changes that I made to them were far more noticable and varied in comparison to elements for other components. Overall, I am happy with the experience of child themes.
