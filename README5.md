# Content Insights
The process of learning how to create a child theme from my WordPress assignment was an intuitive experience, which included the installation and usage of the child theme configurator plugin for the purposes of this practical. As I made modifications to the CSS on my site after inspecting the website code for the desired changes, I went through the process of going through the inspect code in order to find components that were suitable for modification, which is where I then modified the navigation menu elements, as the changes that I made to them were far more noticable and varied in comparison to elements for other components. Overall, I am happy with the experience of child themes.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Upon completion of this practical, 
Upon completion of this practical, I began looking further into the modern web design process, in particular the ways in which the focal point of a website or an image on 
a website, is made distinct from other elements. The creation of this contrast on a website (often referred to as 'white noise') draws similarities to dynamics with regard 
to music, where certain components of a website reside in the background to allow other elements to shine through in the foreground. 

Seeing as I personally have a background in music, my learning of this concept was bolstered through prior understanding, and contextualises my judgement with regard to 
designing websites that better accommodate the goals and focal points of web pages, that I create in the future. Going forward past this practical, I will be diving further 
into child themes and responsive WordPress themes in next weeks LinkedIn content.
