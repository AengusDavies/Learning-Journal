# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 3
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the second week of this subject, I learnt the ways in which the Joomla CMS can be utilised on a basic level (shown in the link provided below) with the goal of setting up the website and working on the practical task for week 2, and the first assignment thereafter.

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 6 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The introduction to Joomla CMS that I received from the tutorial video helped greatly in regard to learning how each component worked and operated with one another, in particular the articles, categories and menu features. It also helped to alleviate the initial concerns that I had upon first inspection of the Joomla home screen, which appeared to be quite unintuitive in its design. Overall I am feeling significantly more comfortable regarding my ability to utilise Joomla, and more prepared to learn Wordpress going forward.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Upon completion of this practical, I have learned that the Joomla CMS offers multiple pathways for importing assets, whether it be directly within an article, or within a custom site module, both of which employ what is known as a 'WYSIWYG' editor, or 'What You See Is What You Get'. Going forward past this practical, I will begin learning about Wordpress from this weeks LinkedIn content followed by content from the following week, which goes into detail on blocks and child themes respectively.
