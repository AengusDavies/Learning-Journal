My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources
On the fourth week of this subject, I have learnt about local development & deployment, and the process of employing a virtual machine for the production of websites, in addition to modern web design processes (as discussed in the following links).

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 7 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights
The process of learning how to set up a local environment on my own computer was quite interesting, as I borrowed from my previous experience regarding virtual machines from subjects that I have completed in the past, such as CP1409 - Operating Systems and Shell Scripting. The process was also different in many ways, such as the means by which I initialised my cognacbox virtual machine being from the command prompt, rather than traditionally from VirtualBox directly. I am keen to use local environments further into this subject with the upcoming group project.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Upon completion of this practical, I began looking further into the modern web design process, in particular the ways in which the focal point of a website or an image on a website, is made distinct from other elements. The creation of this contrast on a website (often referred to as 'white noise') draws similarities to dynamics with regard to music, where certain components of a website reside in the background to allow other elements to shine through in the foreground. 

Seeing as I personally have a background in music, my learning of this concept was bolstered through prior understanding, and contextualises my judgement with regard to designing websites that better accommodate the goals and focal points of web pages, that I create in the future. Going forward past this practical, I will be diving further into child themes and responsive WordPress themes in next weeks LinkedIn content.
