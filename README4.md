# Learning-Journal - Aengus Davies - Week 4
My learning journal for CP3402 Content Management Systems

# Learning Activities and Resources


On the third week of this subject, I learnt about the Wordpress CMS and the variety of ways in which it can be utilised with respect to website creation (shown in the link below). The initial goal is the creation and working of the Wordpress website for the week 3 practical and subsequent assignment task.

# Estimated hours
I have spent roughly 6 hours of my own time this week on the subject

# Content Insights


The introduction to Wordpress CMS that I received from the tutorial video helped greatly in my understanding of how Wordpress differed from Joomla. Upon introduction to Wordpress, I could immediately tell that it would be easier to use in comparison to the previous CMS, due to its far more intuitive layout and features, like blocks, pages and posts. I am eager to utilise Wordpress further within this subject.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights


Upon completion of this practical, I have learned that the Joomla CMS offers multiple pathways for importing assets, whether it be directly within an article, or within a custom site module, both of which employ what is known as a 'WYSIWYG' editor, or 'What You See Is What You Get'. Going forward past this practical, I will begin learning about Wordpress from this weeks LinkedIn content followed by content from the following week, which goes into detail on blocks and child themes respectively.
